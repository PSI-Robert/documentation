# Asynchronous JavaScript

**Learning Objectives:**

* Understand the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
* Learn to work with callbacks, promises, and the async/await syntax to handle asynchronous operations.

**Morning Session: Theoretical Introduction and Demonstration**

* **Introduction to Asynchronous JavaScript:**
  * Discuss the event loop and how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations.
  * Explain the importance of non-blocking operations in web development.
* **Callbacks:**
  * Introduction to callbacks as a way to handle asynchronous operations.
  *   Discuss callback hell and its drawbacks.

      ```javascript
      function fetchData(callback) {
        setTimeout(() => {
          callback('Data loaded');
        }, 1000);
      }
      fetchData(data => console.log(data));
      ```
* **Promises:**
  * Explanation of promises as an evolution of callbacks to handle asynchronous operations more effectively.
  *   Creating and chaining promises.

      ```javascript
      let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("Promise resolved!"), 1000);
      });
      promise.then(result => console.log(result));
      ```
* **Async/Await:**
  * Introduce async/await as syntactic sugar over promises, simplifying asynchronous code.
  *   Demonstrate how to use try/catch blocks with async/await for error handling.

      ```javascript
      async function fetchData() {
        try {
          let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
          let data = await response.json();
          console.log(data);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error);
        }
      }
      fetchData();
      ```

**Activities:**

* **Code-Along:** Lead a live coding session to demonstrate fetching data from a public API using all three methods: callbacks, promises, and async/await.
* **Interactive Exercises:** Provide exercises where participants must convert callback-based functions to promises and then to async/await.

**Afternoon Session: Hands-on Practice**

* **Group Activity:** Break into groups to work on a project that involves fetching data from multiple sources and aggregating the results.
  * Each group should implement error handling and discuss the different outcomes based on the approach used (callbacks, promises, async/await).
* **Pair Programming:** Focus on refactoring existing callback-based code to use promises and async/await, emphasizing the readability and maintainability of the code.
